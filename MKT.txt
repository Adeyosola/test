Pick a brand you are familiar with. Describe a promotion for this brand and based on this promotion,
discuss who you think the target market of the brand is in this promotion and why you think this 
is the target market.


Brand Name: Always
Describe promotion: The promotion is based on the power of a woman especially in sports
a niche that is stereotyped to belong men. The promotion showcases women who are the top in 
their chosen sport and it sends out the message that contrary to the belief that women are 
incapable of being fully productive during their periods, with always sanitary pad, women can be as
productive as they want to be during their period.

Based on this promotion, the target market of the brand is professional female athletes between 
the age 13 - 30 and other women who are inspired by them. I think this is the target market 
because the adverts star real female athletes who took part in the 2016 olympics.
